title: Kovel Agreement in Cannabis Industry
description: How to protect communications with your CPA
---
Cannabis businesses are subject to frequent audits. 
And unfortunately, the accountant-client privilege is limited. On the federal level, there is  [26 U.S.C. ยง 7525(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7525) that gives protection in cases of tax advice in civil matters and does not apply to criminal cases.
So, what happens is the IRS, for example, investigates you for tax fraud? The answer is, "do not talk to your CPA." The CPA will be obliged to furnish your conversation to the IRS. 

There is a way around this problem, and it is called  Kovel Agreement. By signing a Kovel letter, you shelter your communication with your CPA by involving an attorney.  The attorney hires the CPA and treats him/her as they would an employee.  This way, the attorney-client privilege is extended to the CPA. The CPA can now continue doing his work without being afraid that he will have to testify against the client. 

Note: This mechanism cannot be used to cloak prior communications. If the taxpayer met with the accountant before retaining the attorney, their communication would not be protected by the attorney-client privilege. And vice versa, you can not use the Kovel agreement for communications about future criminal acts. 

The IRS does not look favorably upon these arrangements. But so far, it can work as long as the agreement is properly written.
