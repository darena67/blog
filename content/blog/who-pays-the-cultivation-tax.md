The cultivation tax is a weird creature. The way the CDTFA went about collecting this tax is confusing for everyone. Besides,  it creates a lot of tension between cultivators and distributors.

***What is subject to the Cultivation tax?***

The cultivation tax is imposed on raw and unprocessed parts of the cannabis plant. There are three tax categories - flower, trimmed leaves, or other parts of the plant. Tax rates are different for each category, with the flower being the most expensive – $154.4 per pound.

***How do you file and pay the Cultivation Tax?***

The Cultivation tax is a part of the Cannabis Excise Tax return. Cultivators themselves (unless they are also distributors) cannot file and pay Excise and Cultivation taxes. The cultivator must remit the tax to the distributor and the distributor must pay this tax to the CDTFA. If the cultivator sells raw products to the manufacturer, the manufacturer collects the tax and then remits it to the distributor. Only Distributors can file and pay Excise and Cultivation taxes.

***Common Issues:***

1. *The distributor is unable to collect the tax*. Some of the cultivators are not aware of the tax and refuse to pay. Sometimes the supply chain has two distributors, and the first distributor has already paid the tax. Sometimes the cultivator present the tax as a discount. The naïve distributor pays the invoice without understanding that the cultivation tax is now passed onto him. Regardless of the scenario, the distributor is put in a tough position. In the case of the CDTFA audit, the distributor will have to explain why he failed to remit the tax.

*2. The cultivator does not receive receipts for the cultivation tax that he paid.* Distributors must provide cultivators with receipts of taxes paid, but they rarely do. Such negligent behavior does not benefit anyone. If an audit happens, the cultivators will point at their distributors, and the CDTFA will scrutinize both parties.

3. *Accounting Treatment.* In the ideal world, the cultivation tax is a pass-through tax that the distributor does not pay. However, in cases when the distributor unknowingly pays the invoice with the cultivation tax presented as a discount, the tax becomes his expense. In this case, accounting becomes more complicated, since this expense will have to be assigned to inventory and expensed gradually.
